# Hangman-Midterm
Mary Boult and Henry Breckenfeld
We constructed a coding project for the purpose of playing hangman. 
We are coding for the game, hangman. 
The program acts as the host and the player guesses the letter. 
Then, the code prompts the player to continue to guess different letters and does not allow for letters to be guessed twice. 
It tracks the mistakes and for each incorrect guess, a body part will be added to the stick figure man. 
The code continues to run until the full word is guessed. 
For the words being guessed, we have created a list of 1.035 words that the code will count as correct answers. 
The outcome of the game (win or loss) is determined by the number of letters guessed and the completion of the stick figure man. 
The game is lost, and the program ends if the player guesses enough letters to complete the stick figure man before the word is guessed. 
The game is won, and the program ends if the player guesses the word before enough letters are guessed to complete the stick figure man.
